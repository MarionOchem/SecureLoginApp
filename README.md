# SecureLoginApp
A one-feature project to learn conditional responses in web frameworks routing and the fondamentals of cryptographic algorithms 

## Tools :
* Node.js
* Express
* bcrypt
* ejs
* nodemon
* pg

## What I have learned : 
* First approach of route parameter handling by passing user info inside the URL
* Dynamically inserting data into a database while implementing error-handling logic to manage insertion errors or conflicts
* Retrieving data that isn't directly accessible from a database
* Parsing parameters inside conditional code within a html template using ejs

## Deferred technical aspects : 
* Implementing real user session management
